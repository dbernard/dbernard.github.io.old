<h2>About Me</h2>

<div class="about">
  <p>
    Hi, I'm Dylan. I'm a Software Engineer in the DC area. I graduated with a
    degree in Computer Science from
    <a href="http://www.msmary.edu/">Mount St. Mary's University</a> in 2012
    where I was also on the Division I Track and Cross Country teams.
  </p>

  <p>
    When I'm not writing code or playing with algorithms I'm grilling, at the
    gym, or hanging out with my main man Jax (the Great Dane). I love to read
    crime novels, specifically anything by
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don_Winslow">Don Winslow</a> or
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Charlie_Huston">Charlie Huston</a>.
  </p>

    social media profiles in the sidebar or
