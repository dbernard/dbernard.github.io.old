## {{ page.title }}

"The Cloud" has been a buzzword for a while now, [something about what the cloud
make people feel / aura it gives off].

### So, what is The Cloud?

The Cloud is the concept of centralized resources allocated to improve
performance and availability.

### What makes Cloud Computing so important?

There are many opinions about The Cloud, but cloud computing has a critical role
to play in modern technology.

Cloud Computing allows users, whether they are large corporations, fresh
startups, or single developers trying to get off the ground, to utilize existing
physical resources tailored to fit their needs. The user doesn't need to pour
money into purchasing, building, and maintaining their own servers - they are
essentially renting what they need.

This concept of "rent what you need" allows the users to expand their services
when they need it to increase performance, or scale back when they can to save
money.

### The Cloud isn't perfect.

While cloud computing is a wonderful thing, there are drawbacks. To scale this
discussion back down, imagine when you sync your photos to a cloud account - do
you know where those photos are now? Probably not, and you might not care as
long as you can access them when you want to.

You might have a cloud account, but you don't actually own the location your
data is stored - the cloud service provider does. You have little to no control
over the availability of hardware on which your data is physically stored, you
have no physical security presence over the facilities that maintain your data.
